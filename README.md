# Sampling Assignment
In this program, we are converting the given credit card dataset (imbalanced) into balanced dataset. Then, Five different samples are created and five different sampling techniques are applied on five different ML models.

Dataset:
https://github.com/AnjulaMehto/Sampling_Assignment/blob/main/Creditcard_data.csv

The sampling techniques used are:
•Simple Sampling
•Systematic Sampling
•Stratified Sampling
•Cluster Sampling
•Quota Sampling

The five machine learning models used in this program are:
•Logistic Regression
•Random Forest 
•KNeighbors 
•Gradient Boosting
•Decision Tree

In the end, the program determines which sampling technique gives higher accuracy on which model.
